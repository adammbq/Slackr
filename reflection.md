Reflection of iteration 1

What we did well  
We believe that our team functioned very smoothly due to our clear communication and our frequent meetings. We had meetings weekly to go over the work that we had individually completed over the course of that week and to ensure that we were collaborating well. The outcomes of these meetings were very positive and both times, we completed a significant portion of the iteration which helped us have more time in finalising and proofreading. We then discussed our plan of action for the next week so that each of us had a clear idea of what tasks had to be completed. Furthermore, I believe that we split the tasks evenly and fairly, for example allocating a certain amount of tests for each member to complete, so that the task was completed quickly and efficiently. This was also helped by the fact that each member did their fair share of work, and completed the tasks delegated to them. We also had nearly no disagreements in how to approach the tasks which helped the team run smoothly. Any diagreement was resolved quickly thanks to teammates able to compromise and communicate in a positive manner. 

What we could’ve done better   
One improvement that could be made would be to try and focus more on the task during our meetings. Often times we found ourselves distracted, although we still completed the tasks required, so being able to focus better would have made our meetings more time-efficient and effective. 

We started with the Pytests since they were worth the most marks. However, we should’ve started with the user stories first since it would’ve given us a better indication on what to test and how the functions would work based off what the user wants. We then should’ve gone on to do the assumptions since they would furthermore give us better information on how to test each function.

What did we learn  
One of our strengths was good and proper communication. In the ice breaking phase, each of us acknowledged our strengths and weaknesses so that we could have a basic understanding of each other.  We learnt that the beginning phase of a project is the most important because it sets the tone of how well we can do later on.

We learned to combine our individual ideas and work towards a singular goal. It is a learning experience which we will take into the next stage to create an effective solution to the problem.
