<h1> How often you met, and why you met that often ?<h1/>

As a group we had weekly meetings at UNSW J17 to collaborate and discuss what we had been working on throughout the week. During our meetings, we would first outline what we need to achieve in those meeting. Then we would proceed to individual work. If any of us encounter any difficulties, the team would tackle and solve those problems together. 
Throughout the week, we would also be actively keeping in touch with one another through social media and Task Boards like Trello and the Gitlab taskboard. This sort of active communication which took place throughout the course of the term enabled us to only meet once a week, whilst completing all of our tasks to a high level.

<h1> What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful ? <h1\>

A typical group meeting would commence with an outline **(stand up)**of what each group member had completed since the last meeting as well as the discussion of any issues that had arisen throughout the course of the week. 
The group would then begin outlining the goals of the meeting as well as the week to come. To progress was made, frequent collaboration (pair coding) was ensured, and whenever any issues or difficulties arose, we tackled it as a group rather than trying to solve each issue individually which may have taken considerably longer.
During our meeting, we would take regular breaks together to ensure we could work optimally throughout each sprint. We go out for lunch and dinner regularly to keep the vibe light and positive. 

<h1> What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration 3 ? <h1\>

When things did not go according to plan we would discuss online before our weekly meeting about what we were gonna do about it and whether we could fix it easily. An example of this was when we received extremely low pylint scores due to our poor style. One issue with our code was our method of importing in our functions. We were using wildcard imports which upset pylint. So we discussed that we should just import the functions in manually and whilst this seemed very tedious we decided through discussion that it would be worth it in the end. 

<h1>Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code.<h1\>

**Git Branch**
For each category, we all worked on specific functions so that each member could understand the project as a whole. If one of us encountered a problem in our code, we would do pair coding on one machine, this not only decreases the chances of merge conflicts, but it also helps us to learn to work together.  
**Pair Coding**
At times, teammates did not know how to code their own function but due to all members working on the same category of functions, any other member could help and sometimes even more than one person would be needed. 
Furthermore, there was regular discussion about how to store the data and it taught us about meaningful lessons on conflict resolution.
